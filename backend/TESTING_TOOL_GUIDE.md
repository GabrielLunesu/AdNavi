```

### Step 2: Run Tests

...

## Sample Result

```markdown
## Test 17: How much revenue on Google last week?

**Answer**:
> You don't have any Google campaigns connected. You're currently only running ads on Other.

**DSL**:
{
  "metric": "revenue",
  "time_range": {"last_n_days": 7},
  "filters": {"provider": "google"},
  "question": "How much revenue on Google last week?",
  "timeframe_description": "last week"
}
```

**What you learn**:
- ✅ Answer is helpful (explains missing platform)
- ✅ DSL correctly identified Google filter
- ✅ Timeframe correctly detected as "last week"
- ✅ Original question preserved for context

## Real-World Workflow

### When Building New Features
1. Add test questions for the feature
2. Run `./run_qa_tests.sh`
3. Check if answers are good
4. Iterate until perfect

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Add question that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code
3. Re-run `./run_qa_tests.sh`
4. Verify bug is fixed
5. Keep question in suite (regression test!)

### For Quality Reviews
1. Run full suite
2. Review all answers in `qa_test_results.md`
3. Find patterns (what's good, what needs work)
4. Prioritize improvements
