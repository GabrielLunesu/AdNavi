"""
Intent Classifier - Determines Answer Depth Based on Question Type

WHAT: Classifies user questions into intent categories to match answer complexity to user needs
WHY: Simple questions deserve simple answers; complex questions deserve rich context
WHERE: Called by AnswerBuilder before context extraction

Intent Levels:
- SIMPLE: "what was my roas" → Just the number (1 sentence)
- COMPARATIVE: "how does my roas compare" → Include comparison context (2-3 sentences)
- ANALYTICAL: "why is my roas low" → Full rich context (trends, outliers, recommendations)

Design Philosophy:
- Start with simple rules (not ML)
- Based on question keywords and DSL structure
- Easy to understand and debug
- Extensible for future improvements

    Classify user intent from question text and generated DSL.

    (DSL fields) to determine what level of detail the user wants.

        question: User's original question (canonicalized)
        query: Generated DSL query

        AnswerIntent: Classification for answer depth control

    Classification Logic:
    
    SIMPLE Intent - Give me a quick fact:
    - Question starts with "what/how much/how many/show me"
    - NO comparison requested (compare_to_previous=False)
    - NO breakdown requested
    - Example: "what was my roas", "how much did I spend", "show me cpc"
    
    COMPARATIVE Intent - Show me the difference:
    - Question contains comparison keywords ("compare", "vs", "versus", "better", "worse", "higher", "lower")
    - OR DSL has compare_to_previous=True
    - OR DSL has breakdown (breaking down by dimension is inherently comparative)
    - Example: "compare google vs meta", "how does this week compare", "which campaign had highest roas"
    
    ANALYTICAL Intent - Explain it to me:
    - Question contains analysis keywords ("why", "explain", "analyze", "trend", "pattern", "insight")
    - User explicitly asking for understanding, not just data
    - Example: "why is my roas low", "explain the trend", "analyze campaign performance"
    
    LIST Intent - Give me a list of items:
    - Question contains list keywords ("list", "show me all", "give me", "top", "all")
    - DSL has breakdown AND top_n > 1
    - User wants to see multiple items, not just the top performer
    - Example: "give me a list of top 5 campaigns", "show me all adsets", "list campaigns with high ROAS"
