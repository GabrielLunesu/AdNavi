"""Clean database script to remove mock seed data.

WHAT: Removes all mock data from seed_mock.py, keeping only real workspace data
WHY: UI pages are showing mock data instead of real Meta Ads data
WHERE USED: Manual cleanup before production data sync

Usage:
    cd backend
    source bin/activate
    python -m app.clean_db

This script will:
1. Keep workspace "Defang Labs" if it exists (or create new one)
2. Keep real Meta connections (provider='meta')
3. Remove all mock connections (provider='other', external_account_id='MOCK-*')
4. Remove all entities/metrics associated with mock connections
5. Remove all manual costs (optional, can be kept)
