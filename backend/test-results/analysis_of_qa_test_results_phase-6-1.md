# Analysis of QA Test Results (Phase 6.1)

This document provides a detailed analysis of the QA test results from `qa_test_results-phase-6-1.md`, based on the system architecture outlined in `QA_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Executive Summary

The QA system demonstrates strong capabilities in translating natural language questions into executable DSL queries. It successfully handles a wide range of metric queries, including breakdowns, comparisons, and filtering. The intent-based answer generation is a powerful feature, providing context-aware and natural responses.

However, the analysis revealed several areas for improvement, including critical bugs that lead to incorrect or missing data, and opportunities to enhance the quality and helpfulness of the answers.

**Overall Success Rate (Estimated):** While many tests pass, the presence of several bugs that return incorrect or no data for valid questions means the effective success rate is lower than it appears. Key bugs significantly impact queries related to specific entities.

### Key Findings & Recommendations:

1.  **Critical Bug - Entity Filtering**: The system consistently fails when filtering by both `entity_name` and `level` simultaneously. This appears to break the hierarchy rollup logic, leading to incorrect "0" or "No data" answers for valid queries. **Recommendation: This is a high-priority bug fix. The query logic should be adjusted to handle these combined filters correctly.**

2.  **Bug - Single Entity Breakdown**: When a user asks for a breakdown of a single entity by its own level (e.g., breakdown of a campaign by 'campaign'), the system returns an empty result and a "No data available" message, even when summary data exists. **Recommendation: Fix the executor or answer builder to handle this case, either by providing summary data or breaking down by the next level down (e.g., adsets).**

3.  **Bug - Time Comparison**: Queries comparing time periods (e.g., "this week vs last week") are failing during execution. **Recommendation: Debug the execution path for time-based comparison queries.**

4.  **Answer Quality - "List" Queries**: When asked to "list" entities, the system summarizes the list instead of providing it in full. **Recommendation: For lists of reasonable size (e.g., <= 10), the full list should be provided to meet user expectations.**

5.  **Answer Quality - Ambiguous "No Data"**: For queries with metric filters that yield no results, the answer "No data available" is ambiguous. **Recommendation: Provide more specific answers, e.g., "No campaigns met the specified criteria."**

6.  **Logic Gap - Hypothetical Questions**: The system attempts to answer unsupported "what-if" questions by applying filters, leading to irrelevant answers. **Recommendation: The system should be trained to recognize and state that it cannot answer hypothetical questions.**

7.  **Logic Gap - Metric Mapping**: There are cases of incorrect mapping from natural language to system metrics (e.g., "revenue per click" -> `arpv`). **Recommendation: Expand the metric registry or improve the LLM's understanding of metric definitions. Also, improve answer generation for "top performers" with null values.**

## Detailed Analysis

Below is a breakdown of selected tests that highlight the system's strengths and weaknesses.

### Category 1: Successful & High-Quality Responses

These tests demonstrate the system working as intended, with correct DSL translation and high-quality, natural language answers.

---

#### Test 10: "Which campaign had the highest ROAS last week?"

*   **Question Analysis**: A comparative question asking for the top-performing entity based on a specific metric. This aligns with the **COMPARATIVE** intent.
*   **DSL Analysis**: The generated DSL is perfect. It correctly identifies the metric (`roas`), time range (`last_n_days: 7`), breakdown level (`campaign`), and uses `top_n: 1` with `sort_order: "desc"` to find the single best performer.
*   **Answer Analysis**: The answer is excellent. It's two sentences, matching the comparative intent depth. It identifies the top performer, provides the key metric, and adds valuable context by comparing it to the overall workspace average. The conversational tone ("crushing it!") enhances user experience.
*   **Overall Assessment**: **Success**. This is a great example of the system's strengths.

### Category 2: Critical Bugs

These tests reveal bugs that lead to incorrect answers or errors.

---

#### Test 44, 83, 85, 89: Filtering by Entity Name and Level

*   **Questions**: 
    *   "how many conversions did that campaign deliver?" (follow-up to "Summer Sale Campaign")
    *   "How is the Summer Sale campaign performing?"
    *   "What's the CPA for Morning Audience adsets?"
*   **Problem**: All these queries result in answers with "0" data or "No data available", which is incorrect based on data shown in other successful tests.
*   **Analysis**: In all these cases, the DSL includes both an `entity_name` filter and a `level` filter (e.g., `entity_name: "Summer Sale Campaign"` and `level: "campaign"`). Other successful tests querying the same entity *without* the `level` filter return correct data. This strongly indicates that the combination of these two filters breaks the database query, likely by preventing the hierarchy rollup logic from executing correctly.
*   **Overall Assessment**: **Bug**. This is a high-priority issue as it makes asking questions about specific named entities unreliable. The backend logic in `UnifiedMetricService` should be fixed to ensure that filtering by name and level together correctly rolls up data from descendant entities.

---

#### Test 18: Breakdown of a Single Entity

*   **Question**: "give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance"
*   **Answer**: "No data available for last week."
*   **Analysis**: The system correctly identifies the "Holiday Sale - Purchases" campaign and finds its summary revenue ($58,209.15). However, the DSL requests a `breakdown: "campaign"`. A breakdown of a single campaign by the "campaign" dimension results in an empty list `[]`. This empty breakdown causes the answer builder to fall back to a "No data available" template, which is factually incorrect.
*   **Overall Assessment**: **Bug**. The system should gracefully handle a request to break down a single entity. It could either return the summary metrics for that entity or break it down by the next level in the hierarchy (adsets).

---

#### Test 29: Time vs. Time Comparison

*   **Question**: "How does this week compare to last week?"
*   **Answer**: "ERROR"
*   **Analysis**: The system correctly translates the question into a `time_vs_time` comparison query for the default metric `revenue`. However, the execution fails, and the logs are incomplete. This points to a runtime error in the comparison execution logic in `app/dsl/executor.py`.
*   **Overall Assessment**: **Bug**. This core comparison feature is broken and needs to be fixed.

---

### Category 3: Areas for Improvement (Answer Quality & Logic)

These tests produced technically "correct" but suboptimal or misleading answers.

---

#### Test 13: "List all active campaigns"

*   **Problem**: The user asks for a list, but receives a summary ("You currently have 10 active campaigns, including...").
*   **Analysis**: The system correctly retrieves all 10 active campaigns. However, the answer builder chooses to summarize them. For a list of 10, a user who says "List all" likely expects to see all 10.
*   **Suggestion**: The `_build_list_answer` method should be updated to return a full, formatted list when the number of items is below a certain threshold (e.g., 10 or 15).

---

#### Test 54: Hypothetical Question

*   **Question**: "how much revenue would i have last week if my cpc was 0.20?"
*   **Problem**: The system gives the actual revenue, ignoring the hypothetical condition.
*   **Analysis**: The architecture document states that "what-if" scenarios are not supported. The translator attempts to handle this by adding a `metric_filters` for `cpc = 0.2`, which is not the same as a simulation. Since no data matches, the filter is effectively ignored, and the answer is misleading.
*   **Suggestion**: The translator should be improved to detect hypothetical questions. When detected, the system should respond that it cannot answer such questions, rather than providing an incorrect/irrelevant answer.

---

#### Test 71: Incorrect Metric Mapping

*   **Question**: "best performing ad by revenue per click"
*   **Problem**: The system maps "revenue per click" to `arpv` (revenue per visitor), which is incorrect. It then identifies a "top performer" that has a null value for this metric, leading to a contradictory answer.
*   **Suggestion**:
    1.  A new derived metric for `revenue / clicks` should be created.
    2.  The answer builder logic should be fixed to handle cases where the top-ranked item in a breakdown has a `null` value. It should not be described as a "top performer".
