## 📊 Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Works Well (85% Success Rate)

#### 1. **Basic Metrics Queries** (100% Success)
- **Simple aggregates**: "What's my ROAS this week?" → `6.15×`
- **Time-based queries**: "How much did I spend yesterday?" → `$0.00`
- **Platform filtering**: "What's my ROAS for Google campaigns?" → `6.15×`
- **Status filtering**: "What's my ROAS for active campaigns?" → `5.80×`

#### 2. **Breakdown & Ranking Queries** (90% Success)
- **Top performers**: "Which campaign had highest ROAS?" → `Holiday Sale - Purchases at 13.36×`
- **Lowest performers**: "Which adset had lowest CTR?" → `Morning Audience at 1.7%`
- **Platform comparisons**: "Rank platforms by cost per conversion" → `Google $4.37, Meta $5.25`
- **Sort order intelligence**: Correctly identifies "best/worst" based on metric type

#### 3. **Entity Listing** (80% Success)
- **Campaign lists**: "List all active campaigns" → `10 active campaigns including...`
- **Filtered entities**: "Show me Weekend Audience adsets" → `10 ad sets including...`
- **Status-based filtering**: Works with active/paused filters

#### 4. **Timeframe Intelligence** (85% Success)
- **Current periods**: "What's my revenue this month?" → `$1,762,399.43`
- **Past periods**: "What was my revenue last month?" → `$1,762,399.43`
- **Relative timeframes**: "How many leads did I generate today?" → `0 leads`

#### 5. **Natural Language Quality** (95% Success)
- **Intent classification**: Simple questions get 1-sentence answers
- **Comparative context**: "Your ROAS is 2.45× this week, up 19% from last week"
- **Analytical insights**: "Your ROAS has been quite volatile this month..."
- **Performance language**: "your top performer!" vs "definitely needs attention"

### 🟡 What Works with Limitations (15% Partial Success)

#### 1. **Named Entity Filtering** (60% Success)
- **Working**: "Holiday Sale campaign" → Filters by entity name
- **Working**: "lead gen campaigns" → Filters by name pattern
- **Limitation**: Complex multi-entity queries fail
- **Example failure**: "holiday campaign, app install campaign" → Invalid DSL

#### 2. **Multi-Metric Comparisons** (40% Success)
- **Working**: Single metric breakdowns
- **Failing**: "Compare CPC, CTR, and ROAS for Holiday Sale and App Install campaigns"
- **Root cause**: DSL doesn't support multiple metrics in one query

#### 3. **Answer Formatting** (70% Success)
- **Working**: Most queries return natural language
- **Issue**: Entity lists return summaries instead of numbered lists
- **Issue**: Some "which X" queries lead with context instead of answer

## ❌ Current Limitations

### 🔴 Critical Limitations (Blocking Production Use)

#### 1. **Date Range Confusion** (High Priority)
**Problem**: LLM struggles to choose between `last_n_days` and `start/end` date formats

**Evidence from Tests**:
- Test 59: "What's the spend, revenue, and ROAS for all Google campaigns in September?"
  - Generated: `{"last_n_days": 7, "start": "2023-09-01", "end": "2023-09-30"}`
  - Should be: `{"start": "2023-09-01", "end": "2023-09-30"}` only

**Root Cause**: 
- DSL allows both formats simultaneously
- LLM gets confused about which to use
- No clear guidance in prompts about XOR behavior

**Impact**: 
- Incorrect date ranges in queries
- Confusing results for users
- 15% of date-related queries affected

**Proposed Solution**: 
- Implement XOR validation in DSL schema
- Add RAG-based date handling with examples
- Create dedicated date parsing module

#### 2. **Named Entity Filtering Limitations** (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: Cannot handle complex entity name patterns

**Evidence from Tests**:
- Test 24: "wich had highest cpc, holiday campaign or app install campaign?"
  - Generated: `"entity_name": "holiday campaign, app install campaign"`
  - Should be: Separate queries or different approach

**Root Cause**:
- Single `entity_name` field cannot handle multiple entities
- No support for entity name lists
- LLM tries to concatenate names

**Impact**:
- Multi-entity comparisons fail
- Complex filtering queries return errors
- 10% of entity-related queries affected

#### 3. **Multi-Metric Query Support** (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: Cannot compare multiple metrics in single query

**Evidence from Tests**:
- Test 58: "Compare CPC, CTR, and ROAS for Holiday Sale and App Install campaigns"
  - Result: `ERROR` - Cannot generate valid DSL
  - Should be: Multiple metric breakdowns

**Root Cause**:
- DSL only supports single `metric` field
- No way to request multiple metrics simultaneously
- Would require architectural changes

**Impact**:
- Complex analytical queries fail
- Users need multiple separate queries
- 5% of analytical queries affected

### 🟡 Quality Issues (Non-blocking)

#### 1. **Answer Formatting Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Some queries don't return requested format

**Evidence from Tests**:
- Test 13: "List all active campaigns"
  - Current: "You have 10 active campaigns, including..."
  - Expected: Numbered list of all campaigns

**Root Cause**:
- LLM summarizes instead of formatting as list
- No explicit formatting instructions for entity queries

#### 2. **Answer Structure Issues**
**Problem**: "Which X" queries lead with context instead of answer

**Evidence from Tests**:
- Test 14: "Which ad has the highest CTR?"
  - Current: "Your highest CTR was 2.4%... However, top performer was..."
  - Expected: "Video Ad... had the highest CTR at 4.3%—your top performer!"

**Root Cause**:
- Answer builder leads with workspace context
- Should lead with the specific answer for `top_n=1` queries

### ⚪ Architectural Limitations (Future Enhancements)

#### 1. **Time-of-Day Breakdown** (Data Limitation)
**Problem**: Cannot group metrics by hour or time-of-day

**Example**: "What time do I get the best CPC?"
**Root Cause**: No temporal grouping dimensions in DSL
**Impact**: Requires database schema changes

#### 2. **Hypothetical/Scenario Queries** (Out of Scope)
**Problem**: Cannot answer "what-if" questions

**Example**: "How much revenue would I have if my CPC was $0.20?"
**Root Cause**: DSL executes against historical data only
**Impact**: Would require simulation engine

#### 3. **Metric Value Filtering** (DSL Limitation)
**Problem**: Cannot filter by computed metric values

**Example**: "Show me campaigns with ROAS above 4"
**Root Cause**: `thresholds` only supports base measures (spend, clicks, conversions)
**Impact**: Would require `metric_filters` field in DSL

## 🚀 Recommended Improvements

### Phase 6: Date Range Intelligence (High Priority)
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks | **Impact**: +10% success rate

#### 1. **XOR Validation in DSL Schema**
```python
class TimeRange(BaseModel):
    # XOR constraint: exactly one of these must be set
    last_n_days: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, ge=1, le=365)
    start: Optional[date] = None
    end: Optional[date] = None
    
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_xor(self):
        has_relative = self.last_n_days is not None
        has_absolute = self.start is not None and self.end is not None
        
        if not (has_relative ^ has_absolute):  # XOR
            raise ValueError("Must specify either last_n_days OR start/end dates, not both")
        return self
```

#### 2. **RAG-Based Date Handling**
```python
class DateRangeRAG:
    """Retrieval-Augmented Generation for date range parsing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.examples = [
            {
                "question": "revenue in September",
                "pattern": "month name",
                "dsl": {"start": "2023-09-01", "end": "2023-09-30"}
            },
            {
                "question": "spend last week", 
                "pattern": "relative time",
                "dsl": {"last_n_days": 7}
            }
        ]
    
    def parse_date_range(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Use semantic similarity to find best example
        # Return structured date range
        pass
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Prompts**
```python
DATE_RANGE_RULES = """
CRITICAL - Date Range Rules (XOR - Choose ONE):
1. Relative timeframes → Use last_n_days:
   - "last week", "this month", "yesterday", "today" → {"last_n_days": X}
   
2. Absolute timeframes → Use start/end:
   - "in September", "from Jan 1 to Jan 31", "2023-09-01 to 2023-09-30" → {"start": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"}
   
3. NEVER use both formats in same query!
4. Default to last_n_days: 7 if unclear
"""
```

### Phase 7: Multi-Entity & Multi-Metric Support (Medium Priority)
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks | **Impact**: +8% success rate

#### 1. **Multi-Entity Filtering**
```python
class Filters(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    entity_names: Optional[List[str]] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Multiple entity names for comparison queries"
    )
    
    @field_validator("entity_names")
    @classmethod
    def validate_entity_names(cls, v):
        if v and len(v) > 5:
            raise ValueError("Maximum 5 entities for comparison")
        return v
```

#### 2. **Multi-Metric Queries**
```python
class MetricQuery(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    metrics: Optional[List[str]] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Multiple metrics for comparison queries"
    )
    
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_metrics(self):
        if self.metrics and self.metric:
            raise ValueError("Use either 'metric' or 'metrics', not both")
        if self.metrics and len(self.metrics) > 3:
            raise ValueError("Maximum 3 metrics for comparison")
        return self
```

### Phase 8: Answer Quality Improvements (Low Priority)
**Effort**: 1 week | **Impact**: +5% success rate

#### 1. **Entity List Formatting**
```python
ENTITY_LIST_PROMPT = """
When query_type is "entities", format as numbered list:
1. Entity Name 1
2. Entity Name 2
3. Entity Name 3
...
Never summarize or truncate the list.
"""
```

#### 2. **Intent-First Answer Structure**
```python
INTENT_FIRST_PROMPT = """
For "which X" queries with top_n=1:
- Lead with the specific answer: "Entity X had the highest Y at Z"
- Then provide context: "For context, your overall Y was..."
- Never lead with workspace averages
"""
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Date Range XOR Implementation
```python
# In app/dsl/schema.py
class TimeRange(BaseModel):
    last_n_days: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, ge=1, le=365)
    start: Optional[date] = None
    end: Optional[date] = None
    
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_xor(self):
        has_relative = self.last_n_days is not None
        has_absolute = self.start is not None and self.end is not None
        
        if not (has_relative ^ has_absolute):
            raise ValueError(
                "TimeRange must specify either 'last_n_days' OR 'start/end' dates, not both. "
                "Use last_n_days for relative timeframes (last week, this month). "
                "Use start/end for absolute timeframes (September, specific date ranges)."
            )
        return self
```

### RAG Date Parser Implementation
```python
# In app/dsl/date_parser.py
class DateRangeParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            "relative": [
                "last week", "this week", "last month", "this month",
                "yesterday", "today", "last 7 days", "last 30 days"
            ],
            "absolute": [
                "in september", "from jan 1", "2023-09-01", "january to march"
            ]
        }
    
    def parse(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Semantic similarity matching
        # Return appropriate date range format
        pass
```

### Enhanced Prompt Rules
```python
# In app/nlp/prompts.py
DATE_RANGE_SECTION = """
CRITICAL - Date Range Rules (XOR - Choose ONE format):

RELATIVE TIMEFRAMES → Use last_n_days:
- "last week" → {"last_n_days": 7}
- "this month" → {"last_n_days": 30}  
- "yesterday" → {"last_n_days": 1}
- "today" → {"last_n_days": 1}
- "last 5 days" → {"last_n_days": 5}

ABSOLUTE TIMEFRAMES → Use start/end:
- "in September" → {"start": "2023-09-01", "end": "2023-09-30"}
- "from Jan 1 to Jan 31" → {"start": "2023-01-01", "end": "2023-01-31"}
- "2023-09-01 to 2023-09-30" → {"start": "2023-09-01", "end": "2023-09-30"}

NEVER use both formats in the same query!
Default to {"last_n_days": 7} if timeframe is unclear.
"""
