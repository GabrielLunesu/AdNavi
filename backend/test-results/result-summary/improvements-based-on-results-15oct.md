## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Filtering Logic Problems**

#### Test 15: Show me campaigns with ROAS above 4
**Answer**: Only shows overall ROAS (6.29×) and mentions Holiday Sale - Purchases (22.40×) but doesn't list ALL campaigns above 4×
**Issue**: `metric_filters` are correctly generated but not properly applied in breakdown results
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 20: Top 5 adsets by revenue
**Answer**: Only shows top 1 adset instead of requested top 5
**Issue**: `top_n: 5` is set but breakdown only returns 1 result
**Priority**: HIGH

### 2. **Entity Listing Failures**

#### Test 25: Google campaigns are live
**Answer**: Says "10 active campaigns" but doesn't list them
**Issue**: Entity queries return count but not actual entity names
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 51: Show me all lead gen campaigns
**Answer**: Only mentions "Lead Gen - B2B" but doesn't list all lead gen campaigns
**Issue**: Entity filtering by name pattern not working correctly
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### 3. **Timeframe Ambiguity**

#### Test 16: Most leads last week
**Issue**: "Last week" could mean calendar week or rolling 7 days
**Solution**: Always specify exact date range in answers

#### Test 23: ROAS last month
**Issue**: "Last month" could mean calendar month or rolling 30 days
**Solution**: Clarify which timeframe was used

### 4. **Comparison Query Failures**

#### Test 22: Which day had lowest CPC on holiday sale campaign?
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Time-based breakdown queries not supported
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 24: Holiday vs App Install campaign CPC comparison
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Direct entity-to-entity comparisons not supported
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 32: Holiday vs App Install campaign performance comparison
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Multi-entity performance comparisons not supported
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 47: What time on average do I get the best CPC?
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Time-of-day analysis not supported
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Test 58: Compare CPC, CTR, and ROAS for Holiday Sale and App Install campaigns
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Multi-metric, multi-entity comparisons not supported
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 62: Compare spend and revenue between Morning vs Evening Audience adsets
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Adset-level comparisons not supported
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Test 69: Compare CPA, ROAS, and revenue for App Install vs Holiday Sale campaigns
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Complex multi-metric comparisons not supported
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Test 72: Compare clicks, CTR, and CPC for Morning vs Evening Audience adsets
**Answer**: ERROR - DSL generation failed
**Issue**: Adset-level metric comparisons not supported
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. **Data Interpretation Issues**

#### Test 18: Holiday campaign breakdown
**Issue**: 
- "Holiday Sale - Purchases" appears to be an adset, not campaign
- Workspace average calculation seems incorrect ($299,798.95 vs campaign total $46,934.31)
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Test 30: Google vs Meta performance
**Issue**: Only shows ROAS comparison, should include revenue, spend, ROAS for comprehensive comparison
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Conclusion

The Unified Metrics refactor has successfully eliminated data consistency issues. However, several UX and functionality gaps remain, particularly around:

1. **Entity listing and filtering**
2. **Comparison queries**
3. **Time-based analysis**
4. **Breakdown result limiting**

These issues should be addressed in the next development phase to provide a complete and user-friendly QA experience.

## Original Manual Observations (Preserved)

### Test 15: Show me campaigns with ROAS above 4
**Answer**: Your campaigns had a solid ROAS of 6.29× last week, which matches the workspace average—pretty consistent! The standout was the Holiday Sale - Purchases, crushing it with a ROAS of 22.40×.
**Observation**: This doesn't list those campaigns

### Test 16: Which campaign generated the most leads?
**Answer**: The Blog Content Promotion campaign generated the most leads last week with 3,534—your top performer! That's right on par with the workspace average, so it's performing consistently well.
**Observation**: Last week is hard to understand, it can be the week before and the last 7 days, we should specify this

### Test 18: Give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance
**Answer**: Your holiday campaign brought in $46,934.31 last week, which is below the workspace average of $299,798.95—definitely something to keep an eye on. The top performer was the Holiday Sale - Purchases at $4,926.40, but overall, the performance is a bit concerning.
**Observation**: What is the holiday sale - purchases? Is this an adset? I also think the workspace average is calculated wrong here

### Test 20: Give me a list of the top 5 adsets last week by revenue
**Answer**: The top ad set last week was the Evening Audience - Summer Sale Campaign, bringing in $7,786.82—your best performer! Overall, your total revenue was $299,798.95, which is right on par with the average for the workspace.
**Observation**: This didn't list the top 5

### Test 22: Which day had the lowest CPC on holiday sale campaign?
**Answer**: ERROR
**Observation**: Not working?

### Test 23: ROAS last month for holiday sale campaign?
**Answer**: Your ROAS for the holiday sale campaign was 11.87× in the last 30 days, which is excellent! For some context, that's well above the workspace average of 6.43×, so it looks like the campaign really resonated with your audience.
**Observation**: Last month can mean the month before (calendar) or the last 30 days, specify this to user which was picked

### Test 24: Which had highest CPC, holiday campaign or app install campaign?
**Answer**: ERROR
**Observation**: Not working

### Test 25: Which Google campaigns are live?
**Answer**: You currently have 10 active campaigns, including the Holiday Sale - Purchases, Summer Sale Campaign, and Black Friday Deals, among others.
**Observation**: Didn't list them

### Test 30: Compare Google vs Meta performance
**Answer**: In the last 30 days, Google's ROAS was 6.43×, which is right on par with your workspace average. However, Meta's been leading the pack with a solid 9.44×—definitely something to note!
**Observation**: Performance should be: revenue, spend, ROAS
