# Test Results Directory

This directory stores QA test results generated by `run_qa_tests.sh`.

## Files in This Directory

- `qa_test_results.md` - Latest test run results (auto-generated)
- Timestamped results can be saved manually if you want to track history

## Usage

Results are automatically saved here when you run:
```bash
./run_qa_tests.sh
```

## Git Strategy

**Option 1**: Gitignore test results (recommended for local testing)
- Add `test-results/*.md` to `.gitignore` (except this README)
- Results stay local, don't clutter git history

**Option 2**: Track baseline results
- Commit initial `qa_test_results.md` as baseline
- Update when making major improvements
- See quality improvements over time in git history

**Current**: Not gitignored, you can commit if you want to track progress

## Manual History Tracking

If you want to keep multiple test runs:

```bash
# Before major change
cp test-results/qa_test_results.md test-results/qa_results_before_phase4.md

# Make changes...

# After change
./run_qa_tests.sh
diff test-results/qa_results_before_phase4.md test-results/qa_test_results.md
```

**Simple and flexible** - use however works best for you!
