## üî¥ Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: Missing Timeframe Context in Answers

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: User experience, answer clarity

**Problem**: Answers don't mention the timeframe even when the question specifies it.

**Examples**:

```
Q: "what was my ROAS last week"
A: "Your ROAS is 4.36√ó"
‚ùå Should be: "Your ROAS was 4.36√ó last week"
```

```
Q: "What is my CPC today"
A: "Your CPC is N/A"
‚ùå Should be: "Your CPC today is N/A"
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Simple prompt doesn't include timeframe context
- Context extractor doesn't pass timeframe to GPT
- No instruction to mention time period

**Fix Needed**:
1. Add timeframe to context for SIMPLE intent
2. Update SIMPLE_ANSWER_PROMPT to include time period
3. Add time period helper function

---

### Issue #2: Wrong Verb Tense (Present vs Past)

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Grammar, professionalism, accuracy

**Problem**: Answers use present tense ("is") for past events instead of past tense ("was").

**Examples**:

```
Q: "what was my ROAS last week" (PAST)
A: "Your ROAS is 4.36√ó" (PRESENT)
‚ùå Should be: "Your ROAS was 4.36√ó" (PAST)
```

```
Q: "which campaign had highest ROAS last week" (PAST)
A: "Your ROAS is sitting at 4.36√ó..." (PRESENT)
‚ùå Should be: "Holiday Sale had the highest ROAS at 11.58√ó last week" (PAST)
```

**Root Cause**:
- Prompts don't specify tense matching
- GPT defaults to present tense
- No tense detection logic

**Fix Needed**:
1. Add tense detection based on question keywords
2. Update prompts to specify correct tense
3. Include tense instruction in user prompt

---

### Issue #3: Analytical Questions Getting Simple Answers

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Core functionality of Phase 1

**Problem**: Analytical questions ("why") are classified incorrectly and get 1-sentence answers instead of 3-4 sentence analysis.

**Example**:

```
Q: "why is my ROAS volatile"
Expected Intent: ANALYTICAL
Actual Answer: "Your ROAS is 4.36√ó" (1 sentence)
‚ùå Should be: 3-4 sentences explaining volatility, trends, causes
```

**Root Cause**:
- Intent classifier might not be triggering on "why"
- OR Answer builder not using ANALYTICAL prompt correctly
- Possible bug in intent classification logic

**Fix Needed**:
1. Debug intent classification for this question
2. Check if "volatile" keyword is missing from analytical_keywords
3. Verify ANALYTICAL prompt is being used
4. Add more test cases for "why" questions

---

### Issue #4: Robotic Fallback Language

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: User experience (when LLM fails)

**Problem**: Some answers use robotic template language instead of natural language.

**Example**:

```
Q: "How much did I spend yesterday"
A: "Your SPEND for the selected period is $0.00"
‚ùå Should be: "You spent $0.00 yesterday"
```

**Root Cause**:
- LLM might be failing and falling back to template
- Or prompt is too weak to override robotic patterns
- Metric name shouldn't be capitalized ("SPEND")

**Fix Needed**:
1. Check if this is fallback or LLM response
2. Strengthen SIMPLE_ANSWER_PROMPT
3. Fix template fallback to use natural language

---

### Issue #5: Platform Comparison Failing

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Core comparison functionality

**Problem**: "compare google vs meta" returns null answer.

**Example**:

```
Q: "compare google vs meta performance"
A: null
Breakdown: null
‚ùå Complete failure
```

**Root Cause**:
- DSL translator not handling platform comparison correctly
- OR breakdown by provider not working
- Possible missing metric inference

**Fix Needed**:
1. Check DSL translation for platform comparison
2. Verify provider breakdown is supported
3. Add default metric when not specified
4. Test provider filter logic

---

### Issue #6: Multi-Metric Questions Only Answering First Metric

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Question coverage

**Problem**: When user asks for multiple metrics, only the first one is answered.

**Example**:

```
Q: "what was my ROAS last week and revenue"
DSL Generated: metric: "roas"
A: "Your ROAS is 4.36√ó"
‚ùå Missing: Revenue wasn't mentioned at all
```

**Root Cause**:
- DSL v1.x doesn't support multi-metric queries
- Translator picks first metric and ignores second
- Phase 7 feature (not implemented yet)

**Fix Options**:
1. Accept as known limitation (document)
2. Add multi-query support (split into 2 queries)
3. Update error message to tell user to ask separately
4. Phase 2/3 enhancement

---

## ‚úÖ Things That Work Well

### Working Correctly:

1. **Comparison with previous period** ‚úÖ
   ```
   Q: "how does this week compare to last week"
   A: "Your CPC is $0.47 right now, which is a bit up from last week's $0.45‚Äîabout a 5.3% increase"
   ```
   - Natural language ‚úÖ
   - Shows comparison ‚úÖ
   - Mentions percentage ‚úÖ
   - Workspace avg context ‚úÖ

2. **Top performer context** ‚úÖ
   ```
   Q: "which campaign had highest ROAS last week"
   A: "...your top performer, the Holiday Sale, is absolutely crushing it at 11.58√ó"
   ```
   - Identifies top performer ‚úÖ
   - Shows value ‚úÖ
   - Conversational tone ‚úÖ

3. **Intent classification** (mostly) ‚úÖ
   - SIMPLE questions detected correctly
   - COMPARATIVE questions with compare_to_previous work
   - COMPARATIVE questions with breakdown work
