# AdNavi Agentic LLM Roadmap: From Q&A to Marketing Intelligence

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Strategic Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

AdNavi has built a solid foundation with DSL v1.3 - a production-ready Q&A system that translates natural language to database queries. However, to achieve the vision of a **fully agentic marketing intelligence assistant**, we need to evolve from answering "what" questions to providing "why" insights and "how" recommendations.

**Current Stage**: Advanced Q&A System (Stage 2 of 5)  
**Target Vision**: Autonomous Marketing Intelligence Agent (Stage 5)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 6-9 months

## Vision & Goals

### Ultimate Vision
A fully autonomous marketing intelligence agent that:
- **Understands** marketing data at a deep level
- **Explains** complex concepts in simple terms
- **Analyzes** performance with causal reasoning
- **Benchmarks** against industry standards
- **Recommends** actionable improvements
- **Predicts** future outcomes
- **Acts** autonomously (with approval workflows)

### Key Capabilities Required

   - "What caused the spike in CPA?" â†’ Anomaly detection + attribution

3. **Benchmarking Intelligence**

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have (DSL v1.3)

#### âœ… Strong Foundation
- **Natural Language Understanding**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- **Query System**: 3 types (metrics, providers, entities)
- **Metrics**: 24 total (12 base + 12 derived)
- **Context Management**: Multi-turn conversations
- **Data Access**: Hierarchy-aware breakdowns
- **Answer Generation**: Hybrid (facts + natural language)
- **Security**: Workspace isolation, no SQL injection
- **Testing**: 100+ unit tests

#### ðŸ“Š Current Query Examples Working Well
```
âœ… "Which campaign had the highest ROAS?"
âœ… "What was my CPC last week?"
âœ… "Show me CTR by campaign"
âœ… "And yesterday?" (context-aware follow-up)
âœ… "List my active campaigns"
```

### Architecture Strengths
1. **Clean Separation**: DSL â†’ Planning â†’ Execution â†’ Answer
2. **Extensible**: New metrics/features easy to add
3. **Observable**: Full telemetry and logging
4. **Safe**: No direct SQL, validated inputs
5. **Fast**: <1.5s end-to-end latency

## Conclusion

AdNavi has built a solid foundation with DSL v1.3. The path to a fully agentic marketing intelligence assistant is clear and achievable. By following this roadmap, we can systematically add capabilities while maintaining the robustness and safety of the current system.

The key is to build incrementally, validate with users at each stage, and maintain our high standards for testing and security. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a compound effect that will ultimately deliver a truly revolutionary marketing intelligence platform.

**Ready to begin Phase 1?** The educational intelligence features can be implemented immediately without disrupting the current system, providing immediate value while laying groundwork for more advanced capabilities.
