---

## üèÜ What's Working Exceptionally Well (Tests 1-46)

### 1. ‚úÖ Timeframe Detection & Tense (Phase 2 - COMPLETE)
**Status**: Working perfectly across all 46 tests

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 3: "What's my ROAS this week?" ‚Üí "Your ROAS is **4.36√ó this week**" ‚úÖ
- Test 6: "How many clicks did I get last week?" ‚Üí "You had **6,156 clicks last week**" ‚úÖ
- Test 37: "what is my total CVR last month?" ‚Üí "Your total CVR was **8.5% last month**" ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: 
- "This week" correctly shows current week, not "last 7 days"
- "Last week" shows past week
- "Yesterday" shows yesterday
- Past tense for past periods ("was"), present tense for current ("is")

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Graceful Missing Data Handling (Phase 3 - COMPLETE)
**Status**: Excellent explanatory answers when data doesn't exist

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 2: "How much did I spend yesterday?" ‚Üí "**No data available for yesterday yet.** Your ad spend last week was available - try asking about a longer timeframe." ‚úÖ
- Test 11: "What's my ROAS for Google campaigns only?" ‚Üí "**You don't have any Google campaigns connected.** You're currently only running ads on Other." ‚úÖ
- Test 40: "How much revenue on Google last week?" ‚Üí "**You don't have any Google campaigns connected.** You're currently only running ads on Other." ‚úÖ

**Achievement**:
- Platform validation working (detects when Google/Meta/TikTok missing)
- Helpful suggestions instead of "$0.00" or "N/A"
- Lists available alternatives

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Intent-Based Answer Depth (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)
**Status**: Answers appropriately match question complexity

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 3 (Simple): "What's my ROAS this week?" ‚Üí "Your ROAS is 4.36√ó this week." (1 sentence) ‚úÖ
- Test 10 (Comparative): "Which campaign had the highest ROAS last week?" ‚Üí "Last week, your top campaign was the 'Holiday Sale - Purchases' with an impressive ROAS of 11.58√ó, which is way above the workspace average of 4.36√ó. That's a fantastic performance!" (2-3 sentences) ‚úÖ
- Test 27 (Analytical): "Is my ROAS improving or declining?" ‚Üí "Your ROAS was 3.88√ó last month, which is a solid improvement of 46.8% from 2.64√ó the month before‚Äîgreat job! Plus, you're right at the workspace average, so you're performing really well compared to others." (3 sentences with trend analysis) ‚úÖ

**Achievement**:
- Simple questions get concise answers
- Comparative questions include workspace context
- Analytical questions provide insights

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Natural Conversational Language
**Status**: Answers sound human, not robotic

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 7: "Your profit was $3,536.59 last week" (not "Your PROFIT for the selected period is...")
- Test 20: "Your total revenue this month is $77,580.62" (natural)
- Test 25: "This week, you had 522 conversions, which is down 43% from 915 last week‚Äîdefinitely a dip." (conversational tone)

**Achievement**: All answers use natural language with appropriate tone

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Breakdowns & Entity Queries
**Status**: Working perfectly for all hierarchy levels

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 10: "Which campaign had the highest ROAS last week?" ‚Üí Correctly identifies Holiday Sale campaign ‚úÖ
- Test 13: "List all active campaigns" ‚Üí "You currently have three active campaigns: Holiday Sale - Purchases, App Install Campaign, and Lead Gen - B2B." ‚úÖ
- Test 31: "Which adset had the highest cpc last week?" ‚Üí Correctly identifies AdSet 2 ‚úÖ
- Test 33: "Which adset had the highest ctr last week?" ‚Üí Correctly identifies AdSet 1 ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: Campaign, adset, and ad-level breakdowns all working

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Metric Variety & Derived Metrics
**Status**: All 24 metrics working correctly

**Examples from tests**:
- Test 1: CPC ‚úÖ
- Test 5: CVR ‚úÖ
- Test 9: CPL ‚úÖ
- Test 19: AOV ‚úÖ
- Test 41: CPI ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: Base measures and derived metrics all computed correctly

---

## üîç Issues Found in 46-Test Run (6 issues, 13% of tests)

### Issue 1: "Lowest/Worst" Queries Confusing (4 tests affected)
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Low | **Tests**: 32, 34, 36, 43

**Problem**: When user asks "Which adset had the LOWEST cpc/ctr?", the answer talks about workspace average and "top performer" context, which is confusing for "worst performer" questions.

**Examples**:
- Test 32: "Which adset had the **lowest** ctr last week?" 
  - Answer: "...your top performer, AdSet 1 for the Holiday Sale, had a CTR of 1.9%"
  - **Confusing**: User asked for worst, not best

- Test 34: "Which adset had the **lowest** cpc last week?"
  - Answer: "Your lowest CPC last week was $0.47...For context, the **top performer** was AdSet 2 at $0.54..."
  - **Confusing**: For CPC, lower is better, so $0.47 IS the top performer, not $0.54

**Root Cause**: 
1. DSL correctly interprets "lowest" as getting minimum value
2. But answer builder always uses "top performer" language (designed for "highest" queries)
3. For inverse metrics (CPC, CPA, CPL, CPI, CPM), "lowest" = best, "highest" = worst

**Fix Needed**: 
- Detect if metric is inverse (lower is better) or normal (higher is better)
- Adjust language: "best performer" vs "worst performer" based on metric type and query intent

---

### Issue 2: "Breakdown of X Performance" Returns Entity List (1 test affected)
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Medium | **Tests**: 18

**Problem**: When user asks "give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance", system just lists campaigns without showing performance metrics.

**Example**:
- Test 18: "give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance"
  - Answer: "You have four campaigns running: Holiday Sale - Purchases, App Install Campaign, Lead Gen - B2B, and Brand Awareness."
  - **Expected**: Revenue, ROAS, spend breakdown for the Holiday campaign

**Root Cause**: 
- DSL translates to entities query (just list campaigns)
- Doesn't recognize "breakdown of performance" as metrics query with breakdown

**Fix Needed**: 
- Update prompts to recognize "breakdown of X performance" ‚Üí metrics query with default metric (revenue/ROAS) and breakdown by entity
- Add few-shot example for this pattern

---

### Issue 3: What-If Scenarios Not Supported (1 test affected)
**Priority**: LOW (Future Feature) | **Effort**: High | **Tests**: 45

**Problem**: Hypothetical "what if" questions return actual data instead of simulation.

**Example**:
- Test 45: "how much revenue would i have last week if my cpc was 0.20?"
  - Answer: "Your revenue was $12,691.04 last week." (actual, not simulated)
  - **Expected**: Simulation based on different CPC

**Root Cause**: System doesn't support what-if analysis (requires simulation layer)

**Decision**: Out of scope for now. Phase 5 or later.

---

### Issue 4: Time-of-Day Analysis Not Supported (1 test affected)
**Priority**: LOW (Future Feature) | **Effort**: High | **Tests**: 44

**Problem**: Questions about hourly/time-of-day patterns can't be answered with current data granularity.

**Example**:
- Test 44: "What time on average do i get the best cpc?"
  - Answer: "Last week, your CPC was $0.47..." (ignores time-of-day aspect)
  - **Expected**: "Your best CPC is typically between 2-4pm" or "We don't have hourly data yet"

**Root Cause**: 
- MetricFact stores data at daily granularity only
- No hour-of-day dimension

**Decision**: Out of scope for now. Requires hourly data collection.

---

### Issue 5: Empty Question Handling (1 test affected)
**Priority**: LOW (Edge Case) | **Effort**: Low | **Tests**: 46

**Problem**: Empty question string returns a default answer instead of error.

**Example**:
- Test 46: "" (empty string)
  - Answer: "Your revenue was $12,691.04 last week."
  - **Expected**: "Please ask a question" or validation error

**Root Cause**: LLM falls back to default when no question provided

**Decision**: Add validation to reject empty questions before sending to LLM.

## üéØ Revised Roadmap - Next 2 Incremental Phases

### Phase 4: Better Language for Inverse Metrics (1-2 days)
**Goal**: Fix confusing language when asking for "lowest" on metrics where lower is better

**The Problem**:
- User asks "lowest CPC" (wants best performer, since lower CPC is better)
- System returns correct value but says "top performer had higher value" (confusing!)
- Affects: CPC, CPA, CPL, CPI, CPM (inverse metrics where lower = better)

**The Fix**:

**Step 1: Classify Metrics by Direction** (30 min)
```python
# In app/metrics/registry.py
INVERSE_METRICS = {'cpc', 'cpa', 'cpl', 'cpi', 'cpp', 'cpm'}  # Lower is better
NORMAL_METRICS = {'roas', 'poas', 'ctr', 'cvr', 'revenue', 'profit', ...}  # Higher is better
```

**Step 2: Detect Query Intent** (1 hour)
- When breakdown query has top_n=1:
  - Check if metric is inverse
  - Check if question contains "lowest", "worst", "minimum"
  - Determine: "looking for best" vs "looking for worst"

**Step 3: Pass Intent to Answer Builder** (1 hour)
- Add `query_intent` field to context: "best_performer" or "worst_performer"
- Update all three prompts with guidance:
  ```
  If query_intent = "best_performer" and metric is inverse:
    "X had the lowest CPC at $0.47‚Äîthat's your best performer"
  If query_intent = "worst_performer" and metric is inverse:
    "X had the highest CPC at $0.54‚Äîthat's your worst performer, you might want to review it"
  ```

**Step 4: Test** (30 min)
- Test 32: "lowest ctr" ‚Üí Should say "worst performer" (CTR is normal metric)
- Test 34: "lowest cpc" ‚Üí Should say "best performer" (CPC is inverse metric)
- Test 43: "lowest cpc" ‚Üí Should say "best performer"

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ "Which ad had the lowest CPC?" ‚Üí "X had the lowest CPC at $0.47‚Äîthat's your best performer!"
- ‚úÖ "Which ad had the highest CPC?" ‚Üí "X had the highest CPC at $0.70‚Äîthat's your worst performer, might be worth reviewing"
- ‚úÖ "Which ad had the lowest CTR?" ‚Üí "X had the lowest CTR at 1.2%‚Äîthat's your worst performer"

**Effort**: 3 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH (fixes 4 tests, 9% improvement)  
**Complexity**: LOW (just better language)

---

### Phase 5: "Performance Breakdown" Intent Detection (1 day)
**Goal**: Recognize "breakdown of X performance" as metrics query, not just entity list

**The Problem**:
- User: "Give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance"
- System: Lists campaigns (entities query)
- Expected: Show revenue/ROAS/spend breakdown for holiday campaign

**The Fix**:

**Step 1: Add Few-Shot Examples** (1 hour)
Add to `app/nlp/prompts.py`:
```json
{
  "question": "Give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance",
  "dsl": {
    "query_type": "metrics",
    "metric": "revenue",
    "breakdown": "campaign",
    "filters": {"level": "campaign"},
    "top_n": 5
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Update Canonicalization** (1 hour)
- "breakdown of performance" ‚Üí "show me performance by"
- "how is X performing" ‚Üí "show me revenue for X"

**Step 3: Test** (30 min)
- "Give me a breakdown of holiday campaign performance" ‚Üí Should show metrics
- "How are my campaigns performing?" ‚Üí Should show campaign breakdown with metrics

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ "Breakdown of campaign performance" ‚Üí Shows revenue/ROAS/spend by campaign
- ‚úÖ "How is X performing?" ‚Üí Shows metrics for entity X

**Effort**: 2.5 hours  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (fixes 1 test, improves UX)  
**Complexity**: LOW (just prompt engineering)

---

## ‚úÖ What We're NOT Fixing Yet (Future Phases)

### Out of Scope for Now

1. **What-If Scenarios** (Test 45)
   - "What if my CPC was $0.20?" requires simulation layer
   - **Decision**: Phase 6 or later (requires new architecture)
   - **Effort**: HIGH (3-5 days)

2. **Time-of-Day Analysis** (Test 44)
   - "What time do I get the best CPC?" requires hourly data
   - **Decision**: When we have hourly granularity data
   - **Effort**: HIGH (requires data collection changes)

3. **Empty Question Validation** (Test 46)
   - Edge case, low priority
   - **Decision**: Quick fix in Phase 4 (add input validation)
   - **Effort**: LOW (15 min)

4. **Entity Name Filtering**
   - "How is Holiday Sale campaign performing?" requires entity name search
   - **Decision**: Phase 6 (after performance breakdown)
   - **Effort**: MEDIUM (2 days)

5. **Multi-Metric Queries**
   - "Show me ROAS and CPC by campaign" requires multiple metrics in one query
   - **Decision**: Phase 7 (nice-to-have)
   - **Effort**: MEDIUM (2-3 days)
