## Bug #1: Incorrect Date Calculation for "Yesterday"

**Test**: Test 4, Test 12, Test 52, Test 55  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: System queried wrong dates, returned incorrect/missing data

### Problem:
When users asked about "yesterday", the system incorrectly calculated the date range as `[today, today]` instead of `[yesterday, yesterday]`.

**Example**:
- User: "Which campaign spent the most yesterday?"
- System queried: October 29 (today)
- Should query: October 28 (yesterday)
- Result: Returned $0 instead of actual data from October 28

### Root Cause:
`backend/app/dsl/planner.py` line 186-188:
```python
end = date.today()
days = query.time_range.last_n_days or 7
start = end - timedelta(days=days - 1)
```

For `last_n_days=1`, this calculated `start = today - 0 = today`, giving range `[today, today]`.

### Fix:
Added special handling for "yesterday" and "today" based on `timeframe_description` in planner:
```python
timeframe_desc = query.timeframe_description.lower() if query.timeframe_description else ""
if timeframe_desc == "yesterday":
    end = date.today() - timedelta(days=1)
    start = end
elif timeframe_desc == "today":
    start = date.today()
    end = start
```

## Bug #2: AI Hallucination on Empty Data

**Test**: Test 12, Test 55  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: System invented fake data when database returned nothing

### Problem:
When the database correctly returned $0/null for queries with no data, the LLM fabricated detailed answers with specific numbers and entity names that don't exist.

**Example (Test 12)**:
- Query: "Which campaign spent the most yesterday?"
- Database returned: `summary=0.0, breakdown=[]` (correct - no data for Oct 29)
- System answered: "The 'Holiday Promo' campaign spent the most yesterday at $1,200..." (completely invented)

**Example (Test 55)**:
- Query: "best performing ad set in Holiday Sale campaign yesterday?"
- Database returned: `summary=None, breakdown=[]`
- System answered: "The 'Evening Deals' ad set had the lowest ROAS yesterday..." (hallucination)

### Root Cause:
Answer builder was calling the LLM even when results were empty, allowing it to hallucinate.

### Fix:
Added early guard in `backend/app/answer/answer_builder.py` that detects empty data BEFORE any LLM calls:
```python
# EARLY GUARD: Check for empty/null data BEFORE any processing
if (summary is None or summary == 0):
    if not breakdown or len(breakdown) == 0:
        return "I couldn't find any data for {metric} {timeframe}. You may want to try a different time period."
```

## Bug #3: "List All" Queries Limited to 10 Results

**Test**: Test 13, Test 35, Test 64  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Incomplete results when users asked for complete lists

### Problem:
When users asked to "list all active campaigns", the system only returned 10 out of 11 campaigns. Similar issues with other "show me all" queries.

### Root Cause:
1. LLM few-shot examples all used `top_n: 10` as default
2. No explicit guidance for when user says "all"
3. Intent classifier didn't recognize metric filter queries as list queries

### Fix:
1. Added specific example for "list all" with `top_n: 50` in few-shot prompts
2. Added comprehensive `TOP_N` rules section to system prompt:
   - "show me ALL" → `top_n: 50`
   - Metric filter queries → `top_n: 50` (users want complete list)
   - "top 5" → `top_n: 5` (explicit number)
3. Updated intent classifier to recognize metric filter queries as LIST intent

**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/app/nlp/prompts.py`
- `backend/app/answer/intent_classifier.py`

## Bug #4: Context Bleed (Follow-up Questions)

**Test**: Test 47  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: New explicit questions were overridden by conversation history

### Problem:
When user asked "how many conversions did that campaign deliver?", the system inherited the metric from previous question (revenue) instead of using the explicit metric (conversions) in the current question.

**Example**:
- Previous: "which campaign brought in the most?" (revenue)
- Current: "how many conversions did that campaign deliver?" (conversions)
- System returned: Revenue for Summer Sale Campaign
- Should return: Conversions for Summer Sale Campaign

### Root Cause:
Context summary in translator had too-strong directive: "INHERIT THIS if user asks about different time period". LLM was applying this even when user specified a new metric.

### Fix:
1. Softened context summary language in `backend/app/nlp/translator.py`:
   - Changed: "INHERIT THIS if user asks about different time period"
   - To: "Reference this if the user's question is a follow-up about a different time period but doesn't specify a new metric"

2. Strengthened system prompt in `backend/app/nlp/prompts.py`:
   - Added: "CRITICAL: Do NOT inherit metrics or filters from the context if the user's new question specifies its own. The current question ALWAYS wins."

**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/app/nlp/translator.py`
- `backend/app/nlp/prompts.py`

## Bug #5: Misleading Answers for Hypothetical Questions

**Test**: Test 54  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: System ignored hypothetical conditions and answered different questions

### Problem:
User asked: "how much revenue would i have last week if my cpc was 0.20?"
System ignored the "if my cpc was 0.20" condition and just returned actual revenue.

### Root Cause:
System doesn't support scenario/what-if queries but wasn't detecting them. LLM translated hypothetical to a metric_filter, then system ignored the filter.

### Fix:
Added hypothetical question guard in `backend/app/answer/answer_builder.py`:
```python
# HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION GUARD
if dsl.filters and dsl.filters.metric_filters and intent == AnswerIntent.SIMPLE:
    return "I'm sorry, but I can't answer hypothetical questions like that. I can only provide data based on your actual performance."
```

**Files Modified**: `backend/app/answer/answer_builder.py`

## Bug #6: Metric Filter Queries Not Showing Lists

**Test**: Test 58, Test 62, Test 64, Test 66  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Users asking for filtered lists got summaries instead of complete lists

### Problem:
- Test 58: "show me adsets with cpc below 1 dollar" → Only mentioned one adset, not all 10
- Test 62: "show me ads with revenue above 1000" → Mentioned one ad, not the 10 matching
- Test 64: "all adsets with clicks above 500" → Listed 10 but said "10 ad sets" when more might exist
- Test 66: "show me campaigns with impressions over 10000" → Only mentioned top one

### Root Cause:
Intent classifier didn't recognize metric filter queries as LIST queries, so they were classified as COMPARATIVE, leading to summary-style answers instead of lists.

### Fix:
Updated intent classifier to automatically classify metric filter queries as LIST:
```python
has_metric_filters = (
    query.filters and 
    hasattr(query.filters, 'metric_filters') and 
    query.filters.metric_filters is not None and 
    len(query.filters.metric_filters) > 0
)

if (has_list_keywords and has_list_in_dsl) or has_metric_filters:
    return AnswerIntent.LIST
```

## Bug #7: Ambiguous "Performance" Queries

**Test**: Test 59  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: "Worst performing" defaulted to arbitrary metric (CTR) instead of universal metric (ROAS)

### Problem:
User asked: "worst performing ad in App Install campaign?"
System picked CTR arbitrarily. Should default to ROAS (universal performance metric) or revenue.

### Root Cause:
No synonym mapping for generic "performing" → specific metric.

### Fix:
Added canonical mappings in `backend/app/dsl/canonicalize.py`:
```python
"performance": "roas",
"performing": "roas",
```

Now "worst performing" will map to "worst ROAS" which is a more universal performance indicator.

**Files Modified**: `backend/app/dsl/canonicalize.py`

---

## Bug #8: "Profit Margin" Terminology Confusion

**Test**: Test 63  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Wrong metric selected for profit margin queries

### Problem:
User asked: "best performing campaign by profit margin"
System translated to: POAS (profit on ad spend ratio)
Should translate to: profit (actual profit amount)

### Root Cause:
No synonym mapping for "profit margin". LLM guessed POAS which is a ratio, not the margin itself.

### Fix:
Added canonical mapping in `backend/app/dsl/canonicalize.py`:
```python
"profit margin": "profit",
"profitability": "profit",
"net profit": "profit",
```

**Files Modified**: `backend/app/dsl/canonicalize.py`

## Bug #9: Severe Latency Issue on Large Lists

**Test**: Test 15, Test 58, Test 62, Test 64  
**Severity**: CRITICAL (Production Blocker)  
**Impact**: 15-20 second response times on filtered list queries

### Problem:
Metric filter queries that return many results (20-30+ items) were taking 15-20 seconds to respond because the LLM was being asked to format all items into natural language paragraphs.

**Examples**:
- Test 58 (CPC below $1): 37,312ms total (17,020ms just for answer generation)
- Test 64 (clicks above 500): 19,068ms total (16,972ms for answer generation)
- Test 62 (revenue above 1000): 11,979ms total (9,790ms for answer generation)

### Root Cause:
When `top_n: 50` was correctly set for metric filter queries (Bug #3 fix), the LLM was being asked to format 30+ items into prose. GPT-4o with 30 items takes 15-20 seconds.

### Fix:
Added performance optimization in `_build_list_answer`:
- Lists with >10 items: Use **deterministic template** (instant, ~0-5ms)
- Lists with ≤10 items: Use LLM for natural formatting (~1-3 seconds)

Template format:
```
Here are the adsets last week with CPC below $1.00:

1. Morning Audience - Summer Sale: $0.34
2. Evening Audience - App Install: $0.41
...
```

This is clearer and 1000x faster than LLM prose.

**Files Modified**: `backend/app/answer/answer_builder.py`

**Impact**:
- Test 58: Expected latency reduction from 37s → 2s (94% improvement)
- Test 64: Expected latency reduction from 19s → 2s (89% improvement)
- User experience: Sub-3-second responses instead of 20+ seconds

## Testing Recommendations

After deploying these fixes:

1. **Re-run QA Test Suite**: `cd backend && ./run_qa_tests.sh`
2. **Focus on Previously Failing Tests**:
   - Test 4, 12, 52, 55 (date calculations)
   - Test 13, 35 (list all campaigns)
   - Test 47 (context bleed)
   - Test 54 (hypothetical)
   - Test 58, 62, 64, 66 (metric filter lists)
   - Test 59 (ambiguous performance)
   - Test 63 (profit margin)

3. **Manual Verification**:
   - Verify "yesterday" queries return October 28 data
   - Verify empty data returns "no data found" not hallucinations
   - Verify "list all" returns complete lists (check count)
   - Verify metric filter queries show all matching items

---

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] All QA tests pass
- [ ] Date calculations verified for today/yesterday/this week
- [ ] No hallucinations on empty data
- [ ] "List all" queries return complete results
- [ ] Follow-up questions respect explicit metrics
- [ ] Hypothetical questions handled gracefully
- [ ] Metric filter queries show complete lists
- [ ] Performance terminology maps to ROAS
- [ ] Profit margin maps to profit metric

---

## Notes

These fixes address fundamental reliability issues that would have caused serious trust problems in production. The hallucination bug in particular is a showstopper - users cannot trust a system that invents data.

All fixes follow the principle of **fail-safe**: when in doubt, return a clear "I don't have data" message rather than guessing or hallucinating.

**Next Steps**: Run full QA test suite and verify all fixes work correctly before production deployment.
