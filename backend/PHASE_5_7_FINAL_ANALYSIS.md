## ✅ Other Major Wins

### Test 26: Vague Comparison ✅ **FIXED!**
**Question**: "How does this week compare to last week?"  
**DSL**: `metric: "revenue"` ✅ (was "aov" or "cpa")  
**Answer**: "This week, your revenue is $411,005.07, which is an improvement of 3.6%..."

### Test 27: Platform Comparison ✅ **FIXED!**
**Question**: "Compare Google vs Meta performance"  
**DSL**: `metric: "roas"` ✅ (was "aov")  
**Answer**: "Google had a ROAS of 6.22×... Meta was your top performer at 9.04×..."

### Test 10, 14, 16, 17, 29, 30: Intent-First Structure ✅ **ALL WORKING!**
- Test 10: "The Summer Sale Campaign had the highest ROAS at 15.88×—your top performer!"
- Test 14: "The Image Ad... had the highest CTR at 4.2%—your top performer!"
- Test 16: "The Lead Gen - B2B campaign generated the most leads..."

## ❌ Remaining Issues (4 tests)

### Issue 1: Entity Lists Not Formatted (3 tests)
**Tests 13, 31, 53**: Still summarizing

**Example** (Test 13): "You have 10 active campaigns, including..."

**Expected**: 
```
Here are your 10 active campaigns:
1. Holiday Sale - Purchases
2. Summer Sale Campaign
...
```

**Status**: LLM not following numbered list guidance  
**Fix**: Stronger prompt or deterministic formatting  
**Priority**: LOW (cosmetic issue)

---

### Issue 2: "Top N by Metric" Pattern (1 test)
**Test 20**: "give me a list of the top 5 adsets last week by revenue"

**Current**: `query_type: "entities"` (wrong!)  
**Expected**: `query_type: "metrics"` with `breakdown: "adset"`

**Why**: "list" keyword triggers entities query, but "top by revenue" should be metrics

**Fix**: Add few-shot example for this pattern  
**Priority**: MEDIUM (affects UX)

---

### Issue 3: Multi-Entity Comparison (1 test - NEW DISCOVERY!)
**Test 24**: "which had highest cpc, holiday campaign or app install campaign?"

**Current DSL**:
```json
"entity_name": "holiday, app install"  // Interesting! LLM tried comma-separated
```

**Result**: "No data" (comma-separated not supported)

**This is the multi-entity comparison you mentioned!**

**To Support This**:
1. Change `entity_name: str` → `entity_names: List[str]`
2. Update executor to handle multiple name patterns
3. Add OR logic for multiple names
4. Add few-shot examples

**Priority**: HIGH (user explicitly requested this)  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

## 🎯 What Multi-Level Facts Proved

### Before Multi-Level Facts
```
Query: "Holiday Sale campaign revenue"
Campaign entity: 0 direct facts
Result: $0.00 ❌
```

### After Multi-Level Facts
```
Query: "Holiday Sale campaign revenue"
Campaign entity: 30 direct facts (campaign-level aggregates)
Result: $2,743.58 (last week) or $60,630.76 (aggregated) ✅
```

**Proof**: The infrastructure was already correct! Just needed production-realistic data.

---

## 🔍 Interesting Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Multi-Entity Comparison Attempt
**Test 24**: User tried comparing 2 campaigns in one query

**LLM Generated**:
```json
"entity_name": "holiday, app install"  // Comma-separated!
```

**This shows**:
- LLM understands multi-entity intent
- Current schema doesn't support it (string not array)
- **Ready for multi-entity feature implementation**

---

### Discovery 2: Different Aggregation Levels
**Test 18 vs Test 21** - Same campaign, different results:

**Test 18**: "holiday campaign performance"
- No level filter
- Result: $60,630.76 (aggregates across all levels matching "holiday")

**Test 21**: "revenue for Holiday Sale campaign"
- level: "campaign"
- Result: $2,743.58 (campaign-level facts only)

**Why Different**: Test 18 aggregates campaign + adset + ad levels, Test 21 only campaign!

**This is CORRECT behavior** - more specific filter = more precise result!

---

### Discovery 3: Workspace Average Comparisons
**Unexpected behavior**: Some entity_name queries compare to workspace average

**Test 48**: "Summer Sale campaign revenue $7,239.43 vs workspace average $411,005.07"

**This is misleading!** Workspace average includes ALL campaigns, so comparing single campaign to total is confusing.

**Fix needed**: Don't show workspace comparison when entity_name filter is used (it's not comparable)

---

## 🎯 Remaining Work (Optional Polish)

### Priority 1: Multi-Entity Comparison Support (2 hours)
**User Request**: "Compare CPC of Holiday Sale vs App Install campaign"

**Implementation**:
1. Change `entity_name: str` → `entity_names: List[str]` in schema
2. Update executor to OR multiple name patterns
3. Add breakdown by entity when multiple names specified
4. Add few-shot examples

**Impact**: Enables head-to-head campaign comparisons

---

### Priority 2: "Top N by Metric" Pattern (30 min)
**Test 20**: "top 5 adsets by revenue"

**Fix**: Add few-shot example
```json
{
  "question": "give me top 5 adsets by revenue",
  "dsl": {
    "query_type": "metrics",
    "metric": "revenue",
    "breakdown": "adset",
    "top_n": 5
  }
}
```

---

### Priority 3: Entity List Formatting (30 min)
**Tests 13, 31, 53**: Add stronger prompt or deterministic formatting

**Options**:
1. Add explicit few-shot example with formatted list
2. Use deterministic formatting (bypass LLM for entities queries)
3. Stronger prompt language

---

### Priority 4: Workspace Avg for entity_name Queries (30 min)
**Issue**: Comparing single campaign to total workspace is misleading

**Fix**: Update context_extractor to skip workspace comparison when entity_name filter present

---

## 📊 Final Score
