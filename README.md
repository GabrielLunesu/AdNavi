📌 Overview

This project is a cloud-hosted marketing dashboard built as part of a graduation project at Defang Labs.
The goal is to bring together marketing performance data and finance insights into a single, easy-to-use app.

Instead of scattered spreadsheets and reports, the app shows in one screen:

Key KPIs (ROAS, POAS, CPA)

Planned vs. actual spend (P&L view)

AI-powered chat to ask questions in natural language about your campaigns

🚀 Features (MVP)

Connectors for Google Ads and Meta Ads

Real-time KPI dashboard with drill-down (campaign → ad set → creative)

Editable P&L sheet with variance alerts

AI Chat using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to query marketing data

Playful UI with micro-interactions (dark/light mode, confetti 🎉)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL 

Deployment: Defang (currently on playground)

📂 Project Status

This repository is currently focused on building the UI with mock data.
Later iterations will connect APIs and implement backend logic.
