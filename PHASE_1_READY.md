## 🎯 What Phase 1 Will Fix

### Before (Current - Broken)

**Problem 1**: Workspace avg bug
```json
{
  "summary": 3.877...,
  "workspace_avg": 3.877...  // ← Same! Bug!
}
```

**Problem 2**: Over-verbose answers
```
Q: "what was my roas last month"
A: "Your ROAS is stable at 3.88×, which is right in line with your workspace average of 3.88×. Over time, it has shown some volatility, peaking at 5.80× and dipping as low as 1.38× recently..."
```
☝️ 4 sentences when user wanted 1!

---

### After Phase 1 (Fixed ✅)

**Fix 1**: Workspace avg calculation
```json
{
  "summary": 4.5,           // Google campaigns only
  "workspace_avg": 3.0      // ALL platforms ✅
}
```

**Fix 2**: Intent-appropriate answers

**SIMPLE intent**:
```
Q: "what was my roas last month"
A: "Your ROAS last month was 3.88×"
```
✅ Perfect! 1 sentence.

**COMPARATIVE intent**:
```
Q: "how does my roas compare to last month"
A: "Your ROAS is 3.88× this month, up from 3.46× last month—that's a 12% improvement"
```
✅ Great! 2 sentences with comparison.

**ANALYTICAL intent**:
```
Q: "why is my roas volatile"
A: "Your ROAS has been quite volatile this month, ranging from 1.38× to 5.80×. The swings are coming from inconsistent daily performance across campaigns. Your overall average of 3.88× is on par with your workspace norm, but the volatility suggests reviewing campaign settings"
```
✅ Excellent! 3 sentences with full context.

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

After AI implements (or you implement manually), verify:

### Workspace Avg Bug
- [ ] Created `test_workspace_avg.py`
- [ ] Tests FAIL initially (confirming bug)
- [ ] Added debug logging to `_calculate_workspace_avg()`
- [ ] Fixed the bug (removed filters)
- [ ] Tests PASS after fix ✅

### Intent Classification
- [ ] Created `intent_classifier.py`
- [ ] Created `test_intent_classifier.py`
- [ ] All tests PASS ✅
- [ ] "what was my roas" → SIMPLE ✅
- [ ] "compare google vs meta" → COMPARATIVE ✅
- [ ] "why is my roas low" → ANALYTICAL ✅

### Answer Generation
- [ ] Added 3 new prompts to `prompts.py`
- [ ] Modified `answer_builder.py` to use intent
- [ ] Simple questions → 1 sentence ✅
- [ ] Comparative questions → 2-3 sentences ✅
- [ ] Analytical questions → 3-4 sentences ✅

### Testing
- [ ] Created `test_phase1_manual.py`
- [ ] Ran manual tests
- [ ] Tested 10 questions from `100-realistic-questions.md`
- [ ] 8+ questions get correct answers

---

## 🐛 Known Issues Being Fixed

1. **Workspace avg bug** - Shows same value as summary
   - **Impact**: Workspace comparisons are meaningless
   - **Fix**: Ensure workspace avg ignores query filters
   - **Test**: `test_workspace_avg_ignores_provider_filter`

2. **Over-contextualization** - All questions get full analysis
   - **Impact**: Simple questions get verbose answers
   - **Fix**: Intent classification + filtered context
   - **Test**: Manual testing with simple questions

3. **Robotic phrasing** - "Your X for the selected period is..."
   - **Impact**: Sounds like a report, not a conversation
   - **Fix**: Better prompts with natural examples
   - **Test**: Manual review of answer tone

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**After Phase 1**:
- ✅ 90% of simple questions (1-20) get 1-sentence answers
- ✅ Workspace avg ≠ summary when filters applied
- ✅ 0 robotic "for the selected period" phrases
- ✅ Manual quality review: 8/10 questions get 4+ stars

## 🤝 Principles We're Following

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Intent classifier: Detect intent (one job)
   - Answer builder: Generate answer (one job)
   - Each module independently testable

2. **Let AI Do Its Thing**:
   - Don't over-engineer templates
   - Let GPT be creative (but controlled)
   - Match response to user intent

3. **Focus on Fundamentals**:
   - Fix the bug properly (with tests)
   - Clean architecture (no hacks)
   - Good documentation (always current)

4. **Simple > Complex**:
   - Keyword matching (not ML)
   - Clear if/else logic
   - Easy to understand and debug
